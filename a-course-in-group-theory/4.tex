\begin{exercise}
    Which of the following sets \(H\) are subgroups of the given group \(G\)?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \(G\) is the set of integers under addition, \(H\) is the set of even integers;
        \item \(G = S(3), H = \{1, (12), (23), (13)\}\);
        \item \(G = GL(2, \R), H\) is the set of matrices of the form \(\begin{pmatrix} 1 & a \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}\), where \(a\) is any real number.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

\begin{solution}\itemfix
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The identity element of \(\Z_{+}\) is \(0\), which is contained in \(H\). Moreover, even integers are closed under addition and the additive inverse of an integer is even. Therefore, all conditions of 4.2 (2) hold.
        \item No, \((12)(23) \notin G\).
        \item Let \(A_a\) denote \(\begin{pmatrix} 1 & a \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}\). \(A_a \times A_b = A_{a + b} \in H\), because reals are closed under addition. The identity element of \(G\), \(I\) is \(A_0\) and is therefore contained in \(H\). The inverse of \(A_a\) is \(A_{ - a}\), which follows from the statements above.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{solution}

\begin{exercise}
    Give an example of a group \(G\) with subgroups \(H\) and \(K\) such that \(H \cup K\) is not a subgroup of \(G\).
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution}
    Let \(G\) be an abelian group with distinct elements \(1, k, h, hk\). Let \(H = \ev{h} = \{1, h\}, K = \ev{k} = \{1, k\}\). \(H \cup K\) does not contain \(hk\), but contains \(h\) and \(k\).
\end{solution}

\begin{exercise}
    Let \(G\) be the group in Question 2 of Exercises 1. Find the number of elements in \(\ev{A, D}\). Is \(\ev{A, C}\) cyclic? Write down the multiplication table for \(\ev{B, F}\).
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution}
    \(\ev{A, D} = \{I, A, D, B, E, G, C, F\}, |\ev{A, D}| = 8\)

    \(\ev{A, C} = \{I, A, C, B\}\). This group is cyclic, which can be seen from its' Cayley table (see \ref{ex12})

    \(\ev{B, F} = \{I, B, F, D\}\)
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{C|C|C|C|C}
              & I & B & F & D \\ \hline
            I & I & B & F & D \\
            B & B & I & D & F \\
            F & F & D & I & B \\
            D & D & F & B & I \\
        \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
\end{solution}

\begin{exercise}
    Let \(G\) be the group with presentation
    \(\{x,y : x^4 = 1, x^2 = y^2, xy = yx^{ - 1}\}\).
    Decide how many elements are in \(G\) and determine its multiplication table.
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution}
    Consider the order of \(y\). Since \(y^4 = x^4 = 1\), it is \(\leq 4\).

    If \(y^3 = 1\), \(x^2y = 1\) and therefore \(1 = xyx^{ - 1}\), which implies \(y = 1, x^2 = 1\), which contradicts the definition.

    If \(y^2 = 1, x^2 = 1\), which contradicts the definition.

    The only case left is \(y^4 = 1\). Clearly, \(G\) contains all 3 powers of \(x\) and \(y\).

                 & 1    & x   & x^2 & x^3 & y  & y^3  & xy   & x^2y \\ \hline
            1    & 1    & x   & x^2 & x^3 & y  & y^3  & xy   & x^2y \\
            x    & x    & x^2 & x^3 & 1   & xy & xy^3 & x^2y & x^3y \\
            x^2  & x^2  &                                           \\
            x^3  & x^3  &                                           \\

            y^3  & y^3  &                                           \\
            xy   & xy   &                                           \\
            x^2y & x^2y &                                           \\
